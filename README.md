# HA SwitchPlate HASPone

The HASPone is a DIY touchscreen controller you can mount into a [standard North American work box](https://www.nema.org/Standards/ComplimentaryDocuments/NEMA%20WD%206%20-%20Dimensions%20for%20Wiring%20Devices%20-%20Excerpt.pdf).  It connects to your home automation system over Wifi+MQTT to display useful information and to control your smart devices.  The result is an attractive and highly-customizable home controller you can build yourself!

This project is powered by coffee.  [I might get a little weird about it at times](https://github.com/aderusha/RoastLearner), but it's not much of a stretch to suggest that coffee both powers and consumes a fair portion of my mental energy.  [Hook me up if you think HASP is cool](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/gW5rPpsKR).  Thanks!
